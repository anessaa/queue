<h1>What is Queue?</h1>
<p>Queue is an application that was developed by a few General Assembly's WDI Students: Anessa Arnold, Mike Christenson, Patrick Finazzo and Nancy Nguyen.
This application was created with the intention of testing and tracking a student's progress on topics taught in WDI. Queue is a study guide aide that helps the students pinpoint problem areas and understand levels of comprehension on any given tested area. Features include, but not limited to: allowing instructors to create and assign quizzes to students, allow users to sign in with their github account and view results as a student or instructor.</p>

<h1>Unsolved Problems</h1>
<p>While creating this application, we faced multiple hurdles. One of those hurdles (but was identified early-on), was implementing effective communication and identifying miscommunication early on and ensure everyone has a proper turn in expressing their concerns and ideas. </p>
<p>The second biggest hurdle was not being able to identify what a big project developing "Queue" entailed. In the middle of the project we decided, as a group, that this would be more of a study guide and resource for the student to identify their understsanding of the material rather than an app where teachers can identify the overall classes' understanding of the concepts. Pivoting was the key to our success.</p>
<p>The last challenge composed of identifying upcoming problems that arise while building the application. Thoroughly planning through an application such as pseudocoding and what functionality was needed could have made building the application easier</p>


<h1>Future Enhancements</h1>
<p>We hope to continue this project to include some of the following:</p>
<h3>Displaying Completed and Uncompleted Quizzes as a Student</h3>
<h3>Viewing Class Average of a Quiz as an Instructor</h3>
<h3>Integrating HackerNews Feed API</h3>
<h3>Being able to search a student by their github username as an Instructor</h3>
